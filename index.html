							<h3>When I First Saw You</h3>
							<p>This song encompasses the electrifying feeling I had wanted to get to know you and to see what more could happen. (Apparent with how badly I wanted you to come home with me)</p>

							<h3>By The End of The First Night</h3>
							<p>This song explains two things: what it felt as I realized just how badly I wanted to spend the night with you that first night, as well as a more sensual depiction of how it felt in the moments as I was sitting in anticipation and waiting for you to come over for that second night.</p>

							<h3>When You Came Over</h3>
							<p>I know we lied to each other for our first night together saying that we were going to study together before doing anything, but the moment you came out of my room to kiss me, this is exactly what I was thinking. </p>

							<h3>Being With Each Other For The First Time</h3>
							<p>Yeah….This is exactly what it felt like to be with you for the first time. Ignorant of the fact that I had an exam the next day, I would loved for that night to not have ended. This feeling has not gone away.</p>

								<h3>Opening Myself to Love</h3>
								<p>Because of my past relationship, I believed that I no longer knew how to love someone the way that they were meant to be loved which is why I didn’t want to step into a relationship with anyone. But then you came and I’ve never wanted to make someone happy because loving you felt easy and I knew that learning to love you would be one of the greatest experiences in my life.</p>

								<h3>Realizing You Are Perfect For Me</h3>
								<p>It felt like I loved you long before I realized I loved you, which is why when it started becoming apparent to me I almost wanted to stop the feeling from maturing but I didn’t realize that it was much too late and you were too perfect for me for those feelings to stop developing.</p>

								<h3>No More Denial</h3>
								<p>When you sent the video of you singing this song, I knew it. I couldn’t ignore it anymore when I realized that with that incredibly romantic gesture, my heart had already attached itself to you and I was scarred by what it meant. This song will forever be attached to you.</p>

								<h3>Okay? Now What?</h3>
								<p>That night leading up to when I finally said I love you, I was starting to accept it, but it was still a scary thought to know that I had fallen in love with someone I would not see in a week. The few days I spent with you in my apartment made me only fall deeper until I couldn’t avoid it any longer.</p>

								<h3>The Fear</h3>
								<p>When we said I love you, so many emotions overtook me and it felt like a rush of happiness, anxiety, fear, and excitement all mixed into one, but being with you in that moment made it feel like everything made sense and that it would be okay.</p>

								<h3>Defining My Love</h3>
								<p>I know that this song is speaking about a love story that is more mature than ours but it still encapsulates what I meant behind those three words I said to you in that moment.</p>

								<h3>A Breath of Relief</h3>

								<h3>Our First Kiss In Love</h3>
								<p>The kiss after we finally said I love you. It felt magical and unlike any kiss I had ever had before. This song perfectly encapsulates what that soft but still passionate kiss felt like for me.</p>

								<h3>Trying for Love</h3>
								<p>There was still that everpresent feeling of uncertainty about what would happen to us since I would be leaving in a few days, but it was much too late and we still decided to be true to ourselves and spend those last few days experiencing the love we had for each other.</p>

								<h3>Was it Fate?</h3>
								<p>This song makes me think of those first few days of experiencing love with you and even the days when I had to pack up and leave you. I had a debilitating kind of love with you that felt like a story following destined lovers who would always come together by fate. I never met anyone as perfect for me as you. Even as I had to leave, we were determined to make it still work even though the distance would be a huge challenge, and I’m so eternally grateful that we stepped into this relationship together.</p>

								<h3>Choosing Our Love Everyday</h3>
								<p>I know that it could be considered a choice to love you. I don’t. I was always going to love you, but it was my choice to continue developing what I knew would be something amazing. In every lifetime I’m confident that I will always choose a future with you.</p>

								<h3>MY BABY</h3>
								<p>MY BABY MY BABY…..I say this quite a lot but until you, I’ve always found pet names to be cringe. When I started saying them to you, the beginning of this song would always play as a small happy realization within myself that you were the person I wanted to call “my baby”.</p>

								<h3>Redefining My Love</h3>
								<p>Similar to “I Hear a Symphony” by Cody Fry you, this song is one I thought would define a past relationship but it never felt more real than when I think about it in relation to our relationship. This indeed is no ordinary love. It’s thrilling and frightening and so exciting to explore every day.</p>

								<h3>My Pretty Baby</h3>
								<p>I’ve already told you what this song means to me, but I couldn’t resist adding it to this collection of songs that make me think about you. You now have two of my all-time favorite songs tied to you (no pressure) but this song makes me think both about how I feel about you and how you make me feel with your love. Though I don’t like hearing it when I say it, I think you are an amazing person who’s pretty both inside and out.</p>

								<h3>You're MINE</h3>
								<p>This is a different vibe than the others, but I have to admit that every time you tell me about a story of someone trying to approach you this is what happens, Not in a negative way but in a “ha-ha you lose, I win” kind of way. Makes me feel proud to know that no one else can have you.</p>
