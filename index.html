							<h3>When I First Saw You</h3>
							<p>This song encompasses the electrifying feeling I had wanted to get to know you and to see what more could happen. (Apparent with how badly I wanted you to come home with me)</p>

							<h3>By The End of The First Night</h3>
							<p>This song explains two things: what it felt as I realized just how badly I wanted to spend the night with you that first night, as well as a more sensual depiction of how it felt in the moments as I was sitting in anticipation and waiting for you to come over for that second night.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h3>When You Came Over</h3>
							<p>I know we lied to each other for our first night together saying that we were going to study together before doing anything, but the moment you came out of my room to kiss me, this is exactly what I was thinking. </p>

							<h3>Being With Each Other For The First Time</h3>
							<p>Yeah‚Ä¶.This is exactly what it felt like to be with you for the first time. Ignorant of the fact that I had an exam the next day, I would loved for that night to not have ended. This feeling has not gone away.</p>

							<div class="content">
								<h3>Opening Myself to Love</h3>
								<p>Because of my past relationship, I believed that I no longer knew how to love someone the way that they were meant to be loved which is why I didn‚Äôt want to step into a relationship with anyone. But then you came and I‚Äôve never wanted to make someone happy because loving you felt easy and I knew that learning to love you would be one of the greatest experiences in my life.</p>

							<div class="content">
								<h3>Realizing You Are Perfect For Me</h3>
								<p>It felt like I loved you long before I realized I loved you, which is why when it started becoming apparent to me I almost wanted to stop the feeling from maturing but I didn‚Äôt realize that it was much too late and you were too perfect for me for those feelings to stop developing.</p>

							<div class="content">
								<h3>No More Denial</h3>
								<p>When you sent the video of you singing this song, I knew it. I couldn‚Äôt ignore it anymore when I realized that with that incredibly romantic gesture, my heart had already attached itself to you and I was scared by what it meant. This song will forever be attached to you.</p>

								<h3>Okay? Now What?</h3>
								<p>That night leading up to when I finally said I love you, I was starting to accept it, but it was still a scary thought to know that I had fallen in love with someone I would not see in a week. The few days I spent with you in my apartment made me only fall deeper until I couldn‚Äôt avoid it any longer.</p>

								<h3>The Fear</h3>
								<p>When we said I love you, so many emotions overtook me and it felt like a rush of happiness, anxiety, fear, and excitement all mixed into one, but being with you in that moment made it feel like everything made sense and that it would be okay.</p>

								<h3>A Breath of Relief</h3>

								<h3>Trying for Love</h3>
								<p>There was still that everpresent feeling of uncertainty about what would happen to us since I would be leaving in a few days, but it was much too late and we still decided to be true to ourselves and spend those last few days experiencing the love we had for each other.</p>

								<h3>Was it Fate?</h3>
								<p>This song makes me think of those first few days of experiencing love with you. I never met anyone as perfect for me as you.

								<h3>MY BABY</h3>
								<p>MY BABY MY BABY‚Ä¶..I say this quite a lot but until you, I‚Äôve always found pet names to be cringe. When I started saying them to you, the beginning of this song would always play as a small happy realization within myself that you were the person I wanted to call ‚Äúmy baby‚Äù.</p>

								<h3>Redefining My Love</h3>
								<p>Similar to ‚ÄúI Hear a Symphony‚Äù by Cody Fry you, this song is one I thought would define a past relationship but it never felt more real than when I think about it in relation to our relationship. This indeed is no ordinary love. It‚Äôs thrilling and frightening and so exciting to explore every day.</p>

								<h3>My Pretty Baby</h3>
								<p>I‚Äôve already told you what this song means to me, but I couldn‚Äôt resist adding it to this collection of songs that make me think about you. This song makes me think both about how I feel about you and how you make me feel with your love. I think you are an amazing person who‚Äôs pretty both inside and out.</p>

							<div class="content">
								<h3>You're MINE</h3>
								<p>This is a different vibe than the others, but I have to admit that every time you tell me about a story of someone trying to approach you this is what happens, Not in a negative way but in a ‚Äúha-ha you lose, I win‚Äù kind of way. Makes me feel proud to know that no one else can have you.</p>
